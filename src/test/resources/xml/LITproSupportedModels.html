| circle |  | flux_weight x y diameter  | /* DOCUMENT lpb_circle_diameter(ufreq, vfreq, flux_weight, x, y, diameter)
				
				Returns the Fourier transform, computed at spatial frequencies
				(UFREQ,VFREQ) given in 1/rad, of a normalized circle of diameter DIAMETER
				(milliarcsecond) and centered at coordinates (X,Y) (milliarcsecond).
